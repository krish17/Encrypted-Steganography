# Encrypted-Steganography

The main objective of this project is to create a tool that can be used to hide data inside a 24-bit color image. This tool will use an image degradation approach to effectively hide the message. The tool allows the user to upload the key, message and image, which the message is embedded in. The image with message in it is called stegomedium. In order to decrypt that message a secret key is needed. 
	The specific goal is to create a tool that helps in sending secret messages so that only sender and receiver knows the existence of the message.
